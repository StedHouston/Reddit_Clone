            I like Johnny Litecoin and Rebecca White
            (I_make_lemonade). Johnny works on setting
            up crypto commerce for actual merchants and
            is a big advicate for LTC. Rebecca runs our
            local Pittsburgh meetup and went sort of viral
            with a video on using Litecoin at a local food
            truck. But...the more normal folks dont get as
            much attention cause we as humans tend to watch
            flashy dumpster fires instead.
